User *georgianna_bechtelar* currently is leading in number of posts at 24 and 391 average characters, but user *maria.feeney* is holding her own with 410 average characters for each of her own 20 posts. Which of the two is more prolific? We can't presume to know how many crosswords they fill out in their spare times, so we think it's pretty neck-and-neck. Keep an eye on both these ladies to see how things shape up!
